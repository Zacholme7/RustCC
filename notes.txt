Introduction
----------------
- a compiler just translates one language into another
- assembler takes in assembly program and outputs object file
- linker combines object files and resolves all symbols/references
- preprocessor strips comments and executes preprocessor directives

Part 1: The Basics
----------------
- lexer breaks up source code into tokens
    - delimiters, arithmetic symbols, keywords, identifiers
- parser converts list of tokens into abstract syntax tree (AST)
    - program in form we can traverse and analyze
- assembly generation converts AST into assembly 
- code emission writes assembly code to file to be turned into executable

	.globl	_main                           ## -- Begin function main
_main:                                  ## @main
	movl	$2, %eax
	retq

- .globl main is an assembler directive, provides directions for the assembler
    - main is a symbol (name for mem address)
    - says main is a global symbol
- _main is a label for the ode that follows it
    - marks the location that a symbol refers to

- linker adds wrapped code, crt0, to handle setup before main runs and teardown
    - makes funcion call to main
    - retrives value from main
    - invokes exit system call passing it return value from main

- symbol resolution: linker associated each symbol with memory address
then does relocation updatting every symbol to corresponding address instead

The lexer
- read in a source file and output a list of tokens
- identifier: ASCII letter or underscore followed by mix of letters, underscores, and digits
    - case sensative
- integer constant consists of one or more digits

The parser
- accepts a list of tokens from the lexer
- generate Abstract syntax tree
- can write parser yourself or use generator

- building ast for 
if a < b {
    return 2 + 2;
}
    - If statement is the root node
        - condition a < b
            - left operand, a, 
            - operator, <
            - right operand, b
        - statement body, return 2 + 2;
    ...
book has the whole ast

AST defines all of the tokens
    - it does not have anything that makes up the language
    - ex: doesnt say return must tend in ;

- need a set of rules definintg how to build a language construct from a list of tokens
- this is a formal grammar

<program> ::= <function>
<function> ::= "int" <identifier> "(" "void" ")" "{" <statement> "}"
<statement> ::= "return" <exp> ";"
<exp> ::= <int>
<identifier> ::= ? An identifier token ?
<int> ::= ? A constant token ?

- each line is a productino rules
- production rule, non terimal symbola nd terminal symbol

- resursive descent parsing

int main(void) {
 return ~(-2);
}

 .globl main
main:
 pushq %rbp
 movq %rsp, %rbp
 subq $8, %rsp
 1 movl $2, 2 -4(%rbp)
 3 negl -4(%rbp)
 4 movl -4(%rbp), %r10d
 5 movl %r10d, -8(%rbp)
 6 notl -8(%rbp)
 7 movl -8(%rbp), %eax
 movq %rbp, %rsp
 popq %rbp
 ret

- the first three are the function prologue
- final three are the function epilogue
- refer to stack address relative to value in RBP register
- RSP: stack pointer, holds address of to of stack
    - last used, not first free
- stacks grow towards lower memeory addresses
- when you push you decrement rsp, repr lowest address on the stack
- ex: push $3  
    1) write vlaue to next empty spot on the stack
    2) decrement rsp but 8 bytes to point to new top
- pop copies value at top into RAX register

- stack is divided into stack frames
- whenever a function it called, it allocated some memory at top of stack by dec stack pointer
    - this is functions stack frames
- deallocated stack frame upon returning
- RBP/base pointer: points to the base of the current stack frame
- refer to data in current stack frame relative to address stored in RBP

function prologue
    1) push %rbp    
        - saves current value of RBP onto the stack, need for restoring
    2) moveq %rsp, %rbp
        - makes top of stack the base of the new stack frame
    3) subq $n, %rsp
        - decrements the stack pointer by n bytes

function epilogue
    1) movq %rbp, %rsp
        - set rsp back to the bottom of the stackk
    2) popq %rbp 
        - pops off base pointer, rsp not pointers to top of stack again
